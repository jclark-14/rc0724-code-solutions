## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

- to iterate through sets of data allowing you to manipulate the data in different ways

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?

- tells the loop when to iterate. if the condition evaluates to true then the loop will run. if false then the loop will not run

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

- a single run of the loop is an iteration. the loop will keep iterating until condition expression evaluates to false.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

-at the start of every iteration

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

- at the start. before the loop starts iterating.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

- at the beginning of every iteration

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

- after the code block of the loop has run. before the condition expression is reevaluated

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

- break keyword

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

- increment by 1
